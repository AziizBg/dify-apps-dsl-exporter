# Dify Workflows DSL Exporter

A Python tool to export and import Dify workflows/apps as DSL (Domain-Specific Language) YAML files via the Dify console API. This helps teams back up, version control, and migrate workflows between Dify instances they can access.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Install Poetry (one-time setup)
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# 2. Setup project
git clone <repository-url>
cd dify-apps-dsl-exporter
poetry install

# 3. Configure credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Dify credentials

# 4. Download/export all workflows from the configured Dify instance
poetry run python src/export.py

# 5. Upload/import all workflows from ./dsl into the configured Dify instance
poetry run python src/import.py
```

**Output**: All workflows are saved as YAML files in `./dsl/` directory.

## Features

- ✅ **Bulk Export**: Export all workflows from your Dify instance in one command
- ✅ **Bulk Import**: Import exported workflow YAML files into another Dify instance
- ✅ **Fast & Concurrent**: Uses async requests for fast downloads
- ✅ **Automatic Naming**: Files are named after your workflow titles
- ✅ **Duplicate Handling**: Automatically handles workflows with duplicate names
- ✅ **Cookie-based Auth**: Supports Dify's cookie-based authentication
- ✅ **Safe Secret Defaults**: Workflow secrets are not exported unless explicitly enabled
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Retries failed requests automatically

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Poetry** (for dependency management)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Poetry (if not already installed)

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Add Poetry to your PATH (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### 2. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sattosan/dify-apps-dsl-exporter.git
cd dify-apps-dsl-exporter

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

### 3. Configure Your Dify Credentials

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Dify instance details:

```env
DIFY_ORIGIN=https://dify.example.com
EMAIL=your-email@example.com
PASSWORD=your-password
DSL_FOLDER_PATH=./dsl
DIFY_INCLUDE_SECRET=false
```

**Important Notes:**
- Remove any trailing slashes from `DIFY_ORIGIN` (e.g., use `https://dify.dctrl.ai` not `https://dify.dctrl.ai/`)
- For self-hosted instances, use your full URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
- For cloud instances, use the full domain (e.g., `https://api.dify.ai`)
- Keep `DIFY_INCLUDE_SECRET=false` for normal team sharing. Set it to `true` only if you intentionally need exported secret values in the YAML files.
- The tool uses Dify's `/console/api` email/password login flow. Instances that require SSO, MFA-only login, or a different auth flow may need code changes.

### 4. Download / Export All Workflows

```bash
# Make sure Poetry is in your PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Run the export script
poetry run python src/export.py
```

The script will:
1. Authenticate with your Dify instance
2. Fetch all your workflows/applications
3. Download each workflow's DSL file as YAML
4. Save them to `DSL_FOLDER_PATH` (`./dsl` by default)

**Example Output:**
```
Login successful - using cookie-based authentication
Total apps: 25, Total pages: 1
Same name app count: 1, renamed list: ['openai_benchmark_rag -> 【same】openai_benchmark_rag-9c8c995f']
Starting to download YML files...
✅ Downloaded: ./dsl/Benchmarking-prod.yml
✅ Downloaded: ./dsl/demo_RAG.yml
...
```

## Output

All exported workflows are saved in the `./dsl/` directory as YAML files:

```
dsl/
├── Benchmarking-prod.yml
├── demo_RAG.yml
├── get_history.yml
└── ...
```

- Files are named after your workflow titles
- Duplicate names are automatically prefixed with `【same】` and an ID
- Each file contains the complete DSL definition of the workflow

## Additional Features

### Import / Upload Workflows

To import all workflows from `DSL_FOLDER_PATH` (`./dsl` by default) into the configured Dify instance:

```bash
poetry run python src/import.py
```

To import one workflow file:

```bash
poetry run python src/import.py ./dsl/my-workflow.yml
```

### Moving Workflows Between Dify Instances

1. Configure `.env` for the source Dify instance.
2. Run `poetry run python src/export.py`.
3. Review the YAML files from `DSL_FOLDER_PATH` and redact/rotate secrets before sharing.
4. Update `.env` for the target Dify instance.
5. Run `poetry run python src/import.py`.

### Delete Workflows

To delete a single workflow by its app ID (no bulk confirmation needed):

```bash
poetry run python src/delete.py <app_id>
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Running with no arguments deletes all workflows from your Dify instance. It is intentionally blocked unless you provide an explicit confirmation environment variable.

```bash
CONFIRM_DELETE_ALL=DELETE_ALL_WORKFLOWS \
poetry run python src/delete.py
```

## Confluence Tracker Sync + Slack Notification

`src/sync_tracker.py` keeps a Confluence "workflow tracker" page in sync with the
live Dify instance, then posts a status summary to Slack. It is designed to run
unattended on a schedule (see GitHub Actions below), but you can also run it manually.

What it does on each run:

1. Logs in to Dify and fetches every app with its metadata (author, created/updated dates, tags).
2. Reads the current Confluence tracker page (REST API, storage format).
3. Merges by **App ID**:
   - **Existing rows are preserved verbatim** so human-curated columns
     (`Working ?`, `Decision`, `Notes`, `Author & contributor(s)`, `Tags`) are never overwritten.
   - **New workflows** not yet on the page are appended with `Informations added ? = FALSE`
     and metadata pulled from Dify.
   - **Workflows removed from Dify** keep their row but get a red `Removed from Dify` status (history is preserved).
4. Writes the rebuilt page back (version + 1).
5. Posts Slack messages (grouped by contributor so each person sees their own):
   - **Weekly status** + workflows still **pending information input** (`Informations added ?` is not `TRUE`).
   - **Missing environment tag** - workflows whose `Tags` lack at least one of `prod` / `dev` / `test`.

   The two categories are sent as separate messages, and if a category is large its
   per-contributor sections are automatically chunked across additional messages to
   stay within Slack's 50-block-per-message limit.

### One-time setup

Add the following to `.env` (local runs) and as **GitHub Actions repository secrets** (scheduled runs):

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL` | e.g. `https://1dev.atlassian.net/wiki` (include `/wiki`) |
| `CONFLUENCE_EMAIL` | Atlassian account email that owns the API token |
| `CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN` | Create at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens |
| `CONFLUENCE_PAGE_ID` | Numeric id of the tracker page (e.g. `407797761`) |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | A Slack incoming webhook URL for the target channel |

For the GitHub Action the Dify credentials are read from secrets named
`DIFY_ORIGIN`, `DIFY_EMAIL`, and `DIFY_PASSWORD`.

### Run it manually

```bash
# venv runner (installs: httpx python-dotenv beautifulsoup4)
./run.sh sync              # update Confluence + post to Slack
./run.sh sync --dry-run    # compute and print only; change nothing
./run.sh sync --no-slack   # update Confluence but skip Slack

# or with Poetry
poetry run python src/sync_tracker.py --dry-run
```

### Pruning workflows marked "Delete"

`src/prune_deleted.py` deletes every workflow whose `Decision` column on the tracker is
`Delete` (and that still exists in Dify), then flags those rows red `Removed from Dify`
on the page and posts a Slack deletion notice. Deletion is permanent, so it is gated
behind an explicit flag.

```bash
./run.sh prune            # list candidates only (safe, no deletion)
./run.sh prune --yes      # delete + flag Confluence + notify Slack
./run.sh prune --yes --no-slack
```

This is intentionally a manual step and is NOT part of the weekly schedule.

### Scheduled runs (GitHub Actions)

`.github/workflows/sync-tracker.yml` runs the sync **weekly (Mondays 08:00 UTC)** and
exposes a manual **Run workflow** button (with `dry_run` / `no_slack` toggles). After adding
the secrets above, no further setup is required.

> If your Dify host is only reachable on a private network, GitHub-hosted runners will not
> reach it. In that case run `./run.sh sync` from a machine on that network via `cron`
> (e.g. `0 8 * * 1 /path/to/dify-apps-dsl-exporter/run.sh sync`) or a self-hosted runner.

## Troubleshooting

### Poetry Command Not Found

If you get `command not found: poetry`, add Poetry to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Or add it permanently to your shell config (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Authentication Errors (401 Unauthorized)

- **Check your credentials**: Verify your email and password in `.env`
- **Check the URL**: Ensure `DIFY_ORIGIN` is correct and has no trailing slash
- **Check API access**: For self-hosted instances, ensure API access is enabled

### No Workflows Found

- Verify you have workflows in your Dify instance
- Check that your account has access to the workflows
- Ensure the Dify instance URL is correct

### Connection Errors

- Verify your Dify instance is accessible
- Check network connectivity
- For self-hosted instances, ensure the server is running

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: The script logs in to Dify using your credentials and receives session cookies
2. **Token Extraction**: Extracts the JWT access token from cookies for API authentication
3. **Pagination**: Fetches all workflows using paginated API requests
4. **Concurrent Downloads**: Downloads DSL files concurrently (up to 3 at a time) for speed
5. **File Naming**: Sanitizes workflow names for filesystem compatibility

## Security Notes

- **Never commit `.env`**: The `.env` file contains your credentials and should be in `.gitignore`
- **Secrets are excluded by default**: `DIFY_INCLUDE_SECRET=false` avoids exporting workflow secret values
- **Review YAML before sharing**: If you ever export with `DIFY_INCLUDE_SECRET=true`, rotate or remove secrets before sharing
- **Generated folders are ignored by default**: `dsl/` is ignored to avoid accidental commits. Share or version workflow YAML only after reviewing/redacting it.
- **Keep credentials secure**: Share credentials only through secure channels
- **Use environment variables**: For CI/CD, consider using environment variables instead of `.env` files

### Team Workflow

1. **Export workflows** from the source Dify instance.
2. **Review the YAML files** before sharing, especially if secrets were intentionally included.
3. **Version control reviewed DSL files intentionally** if you want history and review; do not commit raw exports blindly.
4. **Import workflows** into the target Dify instance using each team member's own `.env`.
